## Code Challenge 02 for CIT-95 ##
This code challenge will test your understanding of all the following Python concepts that we have covered so far in CIT-95:
Data types, decision and repetition control structures, data structures (arrays), Boolean type, exception handling, sentinel flags, break statements, type coercion and casting, and program logic. 
Complete this code challenge successfully and you will be ready for the midterm program! 
Your program should be concise, but not cryptic. Use comments, snake_style, and proper indentation to make your code self documenting. Your program should be no longer than 50 lines with verbose comments.
Work with your lab partner on this challenge. Use your personal GitHub account and create a public repo that I can see.
